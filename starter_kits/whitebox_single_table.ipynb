    "# Membership Inference over Diffusion-models-based Synthetic Tabular Data (MIDST) Challenge @ SaTML 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "## White Box Single Table Competition\n",
    "Welcome to the MIDST challenge!\n",
    "\n",
    "The MIDST challenge is a multi-track competition aiming to quantitatively evaluate the privacy of synthetic tabular data generated by diffusion models, with a specific focus on its resistance to membership inference attacks (MIAs).\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition focuses on White Box MIA on tabular diffusion models trained on a single table transaction dataset. The schema of the transaction dataset is as follows:\n",
    "| trans_id | account_id | trans_date | trans_type | operation | amount  | balance  | k_symbol | bank | account |\n",
    "|----------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|---------|----------|----------|------|---------|\n",
    "| integer  | integer    | integer    | integer    | integer   | float   | float    | integer  | integer | integer |\n",
    "\n",
    "MIA will be performed over two state-of-the-art methods [TabSyn](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09656) and [TabDDPM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15421). A collection of TabSyn and TabDDPM models will be trained on random subsets of the transaction dataset. The goal is to create an approach (MIA) that can distinguish between samples used to train a model (train data) and other data randomly sampled from the transaction dataset (holdout data) given the model and it's output synthetic data. The `final` set includes 20 models, each with its own set of challenge points (ie train and holdout data), to evaluate solutions on. To facilitate designing an attack, 30 `train` models are provided with comprehensive information about the model, training data and output synthetic data. Additionally, 20 `dev` models are provided to assist in evaluating the effectiveness of attacks prior to making a final submission to the `final` set. Participants can choose to perform MIA over one of or both TabSyn and TabDDPM. In the case of both, the attack that obtains the highest score will be used to rank the submission. A high level summary of the competition is below:\n",

    "Welcome to the MIDST challenge!\n",
    "\n",
    "The MIDST challenge is a multi-track competition aiming to quantitatively evaluate the privacy of synthetic tabular data generated by diffusion models, with a specific focus on its resistance to membership inference attacks (MIAs).\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition focuses on Black Box MIA on tabular diffusion models trained on a multi table dataset (Berka). There are 8 tables in total which are related as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "In particular, MIA will be explored over a state-of the art method Multi-relational Tabular Diffusion Model [ClavaDDPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17724). A collection of ClavaDDPM models will be trained on random subsets of the transaction dataset. Given the synthesis algorithm, model checkpoints, and output for all the tables in the Berka dataset, you are expected to perform MIA on challenge points selected from the Transaction table. You can use the other tables as auxiliary information in your attack development, or ignore them. The `final` set includes 20 models, each with its own set of challenge points (ie train and holdout data), to evaluate solutions on. To facilitate designing an attack, 30 `train` models are provided with comprehensive information about the model, training data and output synthetic data. Additionally, 20 `dev` models are provided to assist in evaluating the effectiveness of attacks prior to making a final submission to the `final` set. A high level summary of the competition is below:\n",

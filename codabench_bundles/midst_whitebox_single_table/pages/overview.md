# MIDST - White Box Single Table

Welcome to the Membership Inference over Diffusion-models-based Synthetic Tabular data (MIDST) challenge of SaTML 2025! 

In this task, you will evaluate the **resilience of the synthetic tabular data generated by diffusion models** against white-box membership inference attacks on a single table dataset.


## Task Details

The generative models are developed on the training data set to generate synthetic data. They are expected to learn the statistics without memorizing the individual data. To evaluate this promise, membership inference attacks assess whether the model distinguishes between the _training data set_ and a _holdout data set_ that is derived from the same distribution as the training set. 

In this task, your goal is to perform White Box MIA on diffusion models trained on a single table (*Transaction*) from [Berka](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marceloventura/the-berka-dataset) tabular dataset. We selected two state-of-the-art diffusion models, [TabSyn](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09656) and [TabDDPM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15421), for this task. We include implementations of each of these models with a dedicated directory in the [MIDST Models](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/MIDSTModels) repository. In each directory, there is a README file that provides an overview of the topic, prerequisites, and notebook descriptions. 

You can choose to attack only TabSyn, only TabDDPM, or both. The highest score you achieve for either of the models is your score for the competition. For example, if the highest score you achieve is 60% for TabSyn, then that is your score for this black-box single-table task, either if you achieve 50% for TabDDPM or do not report any MIA result for TabDDPM. 

## Getting Started

We have provided a [starter kit](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/MIDST/blob/main/starter_kits/whitebox_single_table.ipynb)  that showcases creating a baseline attack and making a submission to this competition. This is a great place to start.

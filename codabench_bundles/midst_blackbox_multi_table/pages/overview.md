# MIDST - Black Box Multi Table

Welcome to the Membership Inference over Diffusion-models-based Synthetic Tabular data (MIDST) challenge of SaTML 2025! 

In this task, you will evaluate the **resilience of the synthetic tabular data generated by diffusion models** against black-box membership inference attacks on a multi table dataset.


## Task Details

The generative models are developed on the training data set to generate synthetic data. They are expected to learn the statistics without memorizing the individual data. To evaluate this promise, membership inference attacks assess whether the model distinguishes between the _training data set_ and a _holdout data set_ that is derived from the same distribution as the training set. 

In this task, your goal is to perform Black Box MIA on diffusion models trained on a multi table (*Transaction*) from [Berka](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marceloventura/the-berka-dataset) tabular dataset. We selected a state-of-the-art diffusion model, [ClavaDDPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17724), for this task. We include an implementation of this model with a dedicated directory in the [MIDST Models](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/MIDSTModels) repository. In each directory, there is a README file that provides an overview of the topic, prerequisites, and notebook descriptions. 
## Getting Started

We have provided a [starter kit](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/MIDSTModels/tree/main/starter_kits)  that showcases creating a baseline attack and making a submission to this competition. This is a great place to start.
